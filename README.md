## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to give the selected effect to only one button at a time and not be able to select them all. Learned how to make a message that only appears after submit. Learned how to not allow the user to submit until a rating is selected and finally learned how to give the user the "You have selected n out of 5" with the number they selected in the thank you message.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning javascript and i intend to do it while completing challenges here instead of just watching tutorials
